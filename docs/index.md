# What is the Local Habitat Suitability Extension?

Local Habitat Suitability generates maps of habitat suitability classes as defined by the user.  Suitability can be determined by forest type, age, time since disturbance, type of disturbance, and forest condition prior to disturbance.  This output extension uses age-only cohort information, so it is compatible with any succession extension.  It can use disturbance information provided by Base or Biomass Harvest and Base or Dynamic Fire.
